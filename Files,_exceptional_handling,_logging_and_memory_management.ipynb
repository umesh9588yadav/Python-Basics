Alternatively, if different exceptions need the same handling logic, they can be grouped together in a single except block by placing them inside a tuple, such as except (ValueError, TypeError):. Additionally, a general except Exception as e: block can be used as a catch-all to handle unexpected errors, though it is considered best practice to catch specific exceptions whenever possible for clarity and reliability."
